## About Schema Diff

### ðŸ“– Overview
Schema Diff is a transformative tool specially crafted for developers maneuvering through Empress Doctypes (schema). It revolutionizes the way you track and visualize changes in your schema, replacing traditional cumbersome methods with a streamlined, efficient process. Use Schema Diff as a standalone CLI tool, or seamlessly incorporate it into your Github action or CI workflow to generate a comprehensive diff of schema changes.

### ðŸŒŸ Key Features
- Generates a meaningful diff of schema changes, enhancing visibility and understanding of changes.
- Designed for flexible use - as a standalone CLI tool or integrated into Github action or CI workflow.
- Contains a unique feature to account for the deletion or reordering of elements in a list of dictionaries.

### ðŸŽ¯ Target Audience
Ideal for developers working with Empress Doctypes who need to track schema changes effectively and efficiently.

### ðŸ›  Built With
Schema Diff leverages the power of the following major libraries:
- [json-source-map](https://pypi.org/project/json-source-map/) for fetching line numbers for diffed data.
- [Rich](https://pypi.org/project/rich/) for Python output formatting.

## Technical Stack and Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have a Python version installed that's compatible with the libraries above.

### Installation
To get started with Schema Diff, clone the repo using this [link](https://github.com/empress-eco/schema_diff.git) and follow these steps:

```sh
# Add this to ~/.bashrc to use Schema Diff with the mechanics of `git diff`
fdiff() {
    (
        export TABLE_MODE=1
        export GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF=~/fsjd/Empress_schema_json_diff.py
        git --no-pager diff "$@"
        unset GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF
    )
}
```

## Usage
To demonstrate Schema Diff in action, use `fdiff HEAD HEAD~1` - this is equivalent to running `git --no-pager diff HEAD HEAD~1` with the GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF environment variable set. After using `fdiff`, `git diff` will work normally.
